You are generating a ROOT CAUSE REPORT for a manufacturing incident.
You MUST follow the JSON schema exactly. Do NOT include any text outside JSON.

Hard rules:
- You may only mention variables that appear in ALLOWED_VARIABLES.
- You may only use causal links that appear in ALLOWED_EDGES or PATHS.
- If uncertainty is high, say so explicitly in "limitations".

Inputs:
TARGET: {target}
INCIDENT_INDEX: {incident_index}

ALLOWED_VARIABLES:
{allowed_variables}

ALLOWED_EDGES (directed):
{allowed_edges}

RANKED_CANDIDATES (already computed; do not change ranking):
{ranked_candidates_table}

TOP_PATHS_PER_CANDIDATE (with edge supports):
{top_paths_json}

INCIDENT_EVIDENCE (z-scores / abnormal flags):
{incident_evidence_json}

Task:
1) Choose the top cause from rank-1 candidate.
2) Use the best supported causal chain from PATHS.
3) Provide recommended actions and tests that are measurable and tied to variables.

Return ONLY JSON.
