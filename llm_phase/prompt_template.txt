You are generating a ROOT CAUSE REPORT for an ANOMALY in a manufacturing KPI.
You MUST return valid JSON only. Do NOT include any text outside JSON.

Hard rules:
- You may only mention variables that appear in ALLOWED_VARIABLES.
- You may only use causal links that appear in ALLOWED_EDGES or PATHS.
- Choose the top cause ONLY from rank-1 candidate in RANKED_CANDIDATES.
- If uncertainty is high, say so explicitly in "limitations".

Inputs:
TARGET_KPI: {target}
INCIDENT_INDEX: {incident_index}

ALLOWED_VARIABLES:
{allowed_variables}

ALLOWED_EDGES (directed):
{allowed_edges}

RANKED_CANDIDATES (already computed; do not change ranking):
{ranked_candidates_table}

TOP_PATHS_PER_CANDIDATE (with edge supports):
{top_paths_json}

INCIDENT_EVIDENCE (z-scores / abnormal flags):
{incident_evidence_json}

Task:
1) Pick the rank-1 candidate as the top cause.
2) Use the best supported causal chain from TOP_PATHS_PER_CANDIDATE.
3) Provide measurable actions and validation tests tied to variables.

Return ONLY JSON.
