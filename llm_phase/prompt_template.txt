You are generating a ROOT CAUSE REPORT for an ANOMALY in a manufacturing KPI.

Return ONLY valid JSON. Do NOT include any text outside JSON. No markdown.

Hard rules:
- You may ONLY use variable names that appear in ALLOWED_VARIABLES.
- You may ONLY use directed causal links that appear in ALLOWED_EDGES.
- The top_cause.variable MUST be the rank-1 candidate in RANKED_CANDIDATES (first row).
- The top_cause.causal_chain MUST be one of the best-supported chains for that candidate from TOP_PATHS_PER_CANDIDATE.
- alternatives (if any) MUST be chosen from other candidates in RANKED_CANDIDATES and must also use allowed edges.

Inputs:
TARGET_KPI: {target}
INCIDENT_INDEX: {incident_index}

ALLOWED_VARIABLES:
{allowed_variables}

ALLOWED_EDGES (directed, use direction exactly):
{allowed_edges}

RANKED_CANDIDATES (already computed; do not change ranking):
{ranked_candidates_table}

TOP_PATHS_PER_CANDIDATE (chains and edge supports):
{top_paths_json}

INCIDENT_EVIDENCE (z-scores / abnormal flags):
{incident_evidence_json}

Output JSON schema (MUST match exactly, no extra keys):
{
  "target": "<TARGET_KPI>",
  "incident_index": <INCIDENT_INDEX>,
  "top_cause": {
    "variable": "<rank-1 candidate>",
    "causal_chain": ["<var1>", "<var2>", "...", "<TARGET_KPI>"]
  },
  "alternatives": [
    {
      "variable": "<candidate>",
      "causal_chain": ["<var1>", "<var2>", "...", "<TARGET_KPI>"]
    }
  ],
  "recommended_actions": ["<measurable action tied to variables>", "..."],
  "validation_tests": ["<test tied to causal chain>", "..."],
  "limitations": ["<uncertainty/limitations>", "..."]
}

Now produce the JSON only.
